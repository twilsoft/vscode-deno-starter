# Vscode <> Deno starter

Template for getting up and running with Deno, Typescript, VScode

## Requirements

[Deno](https://deno.land), to run anything.

For script execution, this template uses
[Velociraptor](https://velociraptor.run/).

Dependency management will happen in `import_map.json` - you can use
[TRex](https://deno.land/x/trex) for this.
